        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a current student at North Carolina State University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Development.  
            I also have a Minor in both Music Studies and Japanese Language.  I've been playing games ever since I got my own DS and ever since I got WarioWare DIY for the DS and started
        making my own minigames, I couldn't stop myself from trying to learn how to develop larger games!</p><p></p>
        <p>My interests lie in the usual surface level game developmental roles such as design and gameplay programming, but recently I've found a great interest in "game engineering" roles
            that take a look at all the tools and systems that surround a game's development.
        </p><p></p>
        <p>Some of my favorite games are The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Overwatch 2, Shovel Knight, and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.  </p>
