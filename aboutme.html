        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a current student at North Carolina State University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Game Development.  
            I also have a Minor in both Music Studies and Japanese Language.  I've been playing games ever since I got my own DS and ever since I got WarioWare DIY for the DS and started
        making my own minigames, I couldn't stop myself from trying to learn how to develop larger games!</p><p></p>
        <p>My interests lie in the usual surface level game developmental roles such as design and gameplay programming, but recently I've found a great interest in "game engineering" roles
            that take a look at all the tools and systems that surround a game's development with my main interests lying in engine and tools development/programming.
        </p><p></p>
        <p>A lot of my experience comes from the Video Game Development Club at NC State that houses a ton of creative developers.  I've been able to form really valuable friendships that 
            not only taught me the software and tools that game developers use but also gave me the skills to work on teams of people that span across disciplines and skill levels.
        </p>
        <p>I'm also a part of NC States Esports Club in which I am the Game Head for Overwatch 2.  I oversee all the events and logistics that surround that game in the club such as 
            setting up and running tryouts for the teams, casual game nights, as well as playing on a team myself!  Towards the end of my time at NC State I've been able to see the Overwatch 2 
            and Esports community grow and get stronger!  That is half due to our newly hired Esports Director and I've even been able to have a lot of chats with him about the state of not only 
            the club but also the Esports scene as a whole and has given me a lot of insight into things I wasn't able see before!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my first two years I was a percussionist in NC State's Civic Symphony.  I've done band all throughout my public schooling but I'm very proud to have been a part of this 
            ensemble.  The ensemble tackled pieces from all walks of classical life, spanning from the older classics to showcasing World Premiers of newer or lesser known composers and 
            I've been able to bring this mentality of experiencing and showcasing newer and lesser known experiences and creative works to how I look at games as well and I believe it to 
            be a very important part of continuing the growth of all creative fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm very happy for the experiences I've had at NC State and can't wait to show what I can bring to the world!
        </p><p></p>
        <p>Some of my favorite games are The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Overwatch 2, Shovel Knight, and Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.</p>
